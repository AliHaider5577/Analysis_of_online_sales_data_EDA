# EDA of Online Sales Data

## About the Dataset
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of online sales transactions across different product categories. Each row represents a single transaction with detailed information such as the order ID, date, category, product name, quantity sold, unit price, total price, region, and payment method.

## Data Source
Data is collected from Kaggle. Here is the link of dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data

## Findings
*   **Sales Trends**:  Monthly sales (total revenue) exhibit seasonal peaks, with significant growth during holiday seasons and year-end.

*   The top neighborhoods are primarily located in Brooklyn and Manhattan. This may be due to the fact that these boroughs have a higher overall population and a higher demand for housing.

*   The number of listings alone may not be indicative of the overall demand for housing in a particular neighborhood, as other factors such as the cost of living and the availability of housing may also play a role.
